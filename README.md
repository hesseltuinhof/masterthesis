An Exploration of Multifractal Models in Finance
============

I wrote my masterthesis on the topic of multifractal processes in the context of financial asset modelling.Rather on focussing on the application of such multifractal models to some kind of empirical research question, my work focussed on the theoretical and thus mathematical foundations of two specific multifractal processes: namely the multifractal model of asset returns (MMAR) and the markov-switching multifractal (MSM). Note that the MMAR is nothing else than a (fractional) Brownian motion in multifractal time.

This repository contains all the algorithms as well as the scripts for plotting the results.

In the case that you are interested to run over some pages of the thesis, just drop me a note.
